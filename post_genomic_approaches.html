          <h2>Post genomic era:</h2>
          <p>We have now entered the post-genomic era for many insect species, thanks to which there are new and exciting
          technologies and approaches becoming available to researchers. Such too is the case for Myzus persicae. Below are
          detailed just some of the approaches that are becoming feasible and might prove translatable from other species to M.
          persicae.</p>

          <h2>Epigenomics:</h2>
          <p>It’s not just ordinary genetic information which is heritable. Epigenetic patterns of methylation can be transferred
          from generation to generation as a result of environmental and other external stimuli experienced during an organism’s
          lifetime. This too pertains to aphid species. For instance, the hormonal environment of the mother can influence the
          phenotype of the offspring via epigenetic modifications, often in response to environmental conditions (e.g.
          photoperiodicity etc.)</p>
          <p>Early availability of the genome for the pea aphid gave rise to new epigenomic studies, and the more recent completion
          of M. persicae’s genome will similarly increase the opportunity for comparable study into areas such as insecticide
          resistance.</p>
          <p>Past work in <em>M. persicae</em> has already identified the role methylation plays in activity of the duplicated E4 gene responsible for resistance
          to carbamates/organophosphates. Evidence points to methylation having an activating rather than a silencing role, thereby increasing the capacity for insecticide resistance during the aphid’s life.</p>
          <p>Methods such as methylome bisulfite sequencing will be able to contribute high quality quantitative insights into
          methylation in the genome.

          The complete genome and clone library sequence data available from many populations of M. persiace will no doubt clear
          the way for more extensive epigenomic studies in future which may reveal as yet undiscovered mechanisms of insecticide
          resistance.

          <h2>CRISPR-Cas9:</h2>

          <p>As a gene editing tool, CRISPR-Cas9 boasts unparalleled efficiency in numerous organisms, and has been successfully
          deployed in various insect species, including; <em>Drosophila melanogaster</em>, <em>Pyrrhocoris apterus</em> and <em>Acyrthosiphon pisum</em>, the
          pea aphid.</p>
          <p>Implementation in aphid species is a somewhat more challenging process than in many others, due to the complex
          reproductive system. Egg production in aphids such as M. persiace is governed by a shortening of the photoperiod to
          ensure winter laying. Following this a diapause phase wherein the eggs lay dormant for 2-3 months occurs.
          However, accounting for this, Trionnaire et al developed a CRISPR-Cas9 protocol for the pea aphid A. pisum in 2019.</p>
          This newly developed pea aphid protocol demonstrates proof of concept in a challenging
          aphid model, and given M. persicae presents similar difficulties, these obstacles should ultimately prove surmountable.</p>
          <p> CRISPR-Cas9 is likely to prove a highly versatile tool in M. persicae research, allowing for more complete genetic
          knockdown than RNAi experiments, whilst also permitting gene knock-in studies via homologous recombination using
          template DNA strands.</p>

          regarding potential resistance genes in M. persiace.</p>

  <h2>Arthropod sequence databases / target gene prediction:</h2>

  <p>As mentioned above, we are truly in the post genomic era for a large number of arthropods, and today’s open source
  easily available genomic information means there are huge databases of ever expanding high quality genomes available to
  researchers.</p>
  <p>With continually emerging insecticide resistance in M. persiace and other related pest species, there is need for new
  target site identification. Given the success of G-protein coupled receptors as targets for drugs in pharmacology, these
  proteins are also estimated to be prime targets for new synthetic insecticides. Their mediation of many important
  physiological processes makes them ideal candidates, even being found in upstream control of p450 detoxification genes
  in mosquitoes</p>

  <p>New assemblies, annotations and predicted GPCRs across many species of arthropod are likely to be able to facilitate
  BLAST interrogation against M. persicae’s genome with the potential to reveal hitherto undiscovered GPCRs.</p>


  <p> In 2015, the Insecticide Resistance Action Committee indicated that of the 55 classes of insecticide, only one
  explicitly targets GCPRs, which have been subsequently classified as an underutilised target for insecticide specificity. Therefore gene prediction, both in silico and with functional reverse genetics approaches, provides a real chance to
  expedite novel insecticide development to maintain control of M. persicae pest populations further into the future.</p>
